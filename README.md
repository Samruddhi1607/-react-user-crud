This is a Users Management App built using React.js and Axios, allowing users to:

- View a paginated list of users.

Search and filter users.

Create new users.

Edit existing users.

Delete users.

- Features

Client-side search & filtering

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Pagination for better navigation

- API Used
This app uses the ReqRes API for dummy user data:

https://reqres.in/api/users

- Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router

Styling: CSS

Backend (Mock API): ReqRes (https://reqres.in/)

- Assumptions & Considerations
This project uses ReqRes API, which does not persist data. Any new user created or deleted will not be saved permanently.

Styling is minimal and can be enhanced further.

The app is tested in Chrome and Firefox.
